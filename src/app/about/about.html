  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a Master's student at Northeast Forestry University(located in Harbin, China) with a strong passion for data analysis, cloud application development, and interdisciplinary research. 
    My background in forest ecology and resource management has shaped my analytical thinking and problem-solving mindset. 
    I enjoy building solutions that bridge science and technology, 
    and I’m always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges in both research and software development.
